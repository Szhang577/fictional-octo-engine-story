Long long time ago, there was a poor boy called Aladdin. One day, a rich merchant came into Aladdin's house.
He said, "I will pay you enough money to you mother that you mother can live without work. But I will take you with me for my work."
Aladdin agreed and left home with the merchant. They traveled for many hours, then merchant stopped.
He took out some colored powder and threw them to the ground. After smoke arise and faded away, Aladdin saw a big crack on the ground.
The Merchant told him, "Get inside and take many golds you want. I only need the old lamp, get it out for me."
Aladdin entered the crack.

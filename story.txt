Long long time ago, there was a poor boy called Aladdin. One day, a rich merchant came into Aladdin's house.
He said, "I will pay you enough money to you mother that you mother can live without work. But I will take you with me for my work."
Aladdin agreed and left home with the merchant. They traveled for many hours, then merchant stopped.
He took out some colored powder and threw them to the ground. After smoke arise and faded away, Aladdin saw a big crack on the ground.
The Merchant told him, "Get inside and take many golds you want. I only need the old lamp, get it out for me."
Aladdin entered the crack.

Inside was a dark passageway. The merchant had given Aladdin a torch, but the light was weak and flickering.
As Aladdin descended into the cavern, he saw something flicker in the depths.
When he got close, he saw that there were jewels and gold coins scattered all around the ground.
He grabbed more and more and lined his pockets. He could hardly believe how rich he and his mother were going to be.
Once Aladdin thought he could carry no more he turned around and was about to head back when he remembered the merchant's demand.
He found the old rusty lamp lying in a corner. As he picked it up, his hand rubbed along the metal.
